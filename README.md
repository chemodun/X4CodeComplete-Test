## Original Release Notes (thank you Cgetty)

### 1.0.0

Initial release. Supports scriptproperties.xml autocomplete

### 1.0.1

Major improvements; now has configuration & generates the entries at startup from scriptproperties.xml, removing the need for rerunning a python script when scriptproperties.xml updates.

### 1.0.2

Hopefully, no more duplicate suggestions. Also, Peek/Go to definition for script properties!
